Problem Statement

Despite the increasing number of graduates entering the job market, a significant proportion struggle to secure suitable employment. Employers often cite a mismatch between academic performance, technical skills, and employability attributes as key barriers to recruitment. Understanding the relationship between student academic performance, skill sets, and placement outcomes is therefore critical for universities, policymakers, and recruiters.

This project aims to analyze the Graduate Employability Dataset (Student Performance vs Placement Dataset) to identify the key factors that influence whether a student gets placed or not. By leveraging statistical methods and predictive modeling, we will explore:

Which academic and non-academic factors contribute most to employability?

Can placement outcomes be predicted based on student performance indicators?

What correlations exist between categorical factors (e.g., gender, stream, internship experience) and placement success?

How can insights from this dataset help institutions improve curriculum design and career readiness programs?

The ultimate goal is to build a data-driven framework that provides actionable insights for improving graduate employability, enhancing placement strategies, and supporting students in aligning their academic journey with labor market expectations.
